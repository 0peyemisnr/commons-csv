<h3>WAKE CSV Format Support</h3>

<p>CSV (or its dialects) are widely used as interfaces to legacy systems or
   manual data-imports. Basically CSV stands for "Comma Separated Values" but
   this simple leads to more confusion than definitions.</p>
   
<p>Common to all file dialects is its basic structure: The CSV data-format
   is record oriented, whereas each record starts on a new textual line. A
   record is build of a list of values. Keep in mind that not all records
   must have an equal number of values:</p>
<pre>
      csv    := records*
      record := values*
</pre>

<p>The following list contains the csv aspects the WAKE CSV parser supports:</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Separators</dt>
 <dd>The record separators are hardcoded and cannot be changed. The must be '\n' or '\r\n'.
     The separator (or delimiters) for values is freely configurable (default ',').</dd>

 <dt>Comments</dt>
 <dd>Some CSV-dialects support a simple comment syntax. A comment is a record
     which must start with a designated character (the commentStarter). A record
     of this kind is treated as comment and gets removed from the input (default '(char)0')</dd>
 
 <dt>Simple values</dt>
 <dd>A simple value consist of all characters (except the separator) until 
     (but not including) the next separator or a record-terminator. Optionally
     all leading whitespaces of a simple value can be ignored (default: true).</dd>
     
  <dt>Complex values</dt>
  <dd>Complex values are encapsulated within the defined encapsulator character (default '"').
      The encapsulator itself must be escaped by '\' or doubled when used inside complex values.
      Complex values preserve all kind of formatting (including newlines -> multiline-values)</dd>
      
  <dt>Unicode escapes</dt>
  <dd>Some non-unicode CSVs use unicode escaping sequences for certain unicode characters. The standard
      unicode-escaping is '\uXXXX' whereas XXXX is the unicode-character-code in hex-format. The parser
      can optionally resolve unicode escapes (default: disabled).</dd>
  <dt>Empty line skipping</dt>
  <dd>Optionally empty lines in CSV files might be skiped. Not skiping empty lines will return
      an empty record on '\nEOF' combinations.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to individually defined dialects, two predefined dialects (strict-csv, and excel-csv) 
   can be set directly.</p>  

<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre><blockquote> 
String[] parsedLine = CSVParser.parseLine("a,b,c");
for (int i = 0; i &lt; parsedLine.length; ++i) {
  System.out.println("value " + i + "=" + parsedLine[i]);
}
</blockquote></pre>
